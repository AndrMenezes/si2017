# Methods of Bias Correction of Maximum Likelihood Estimators

> My last scientific initiation developed during the graduation of statistics under the guidance of professor 
[Josmar Mazucheli](http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?id=K4799931Y7) 
with period of validity from Ago/2017 to July/2018. 


## Summary
In this project I studied the three approach to obtain bias-corrected maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of 
any probability distribution. 
We also introduce the `mle.tools` package which can be used to computes the expected/observed Fisher information and the bias corrected
estimates for the parameters of any probability distribution. 
It should be point out that several articles were producing during this project. 
They can be found [here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andre_Menezes2).
